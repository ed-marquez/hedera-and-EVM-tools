# Building with Hedera and EVM Tools for Success in a Multi-Chain Landscape
The availability of layer-1 and layer-2 networks for web 3 developers to deploy smart contracts and tokenize assets has increased drastically in recent years. With so many options, more developers are choosing to deploy their applications to multiple chains or migrate to stable, EVM-compatible networks like Hedera.

In this session, we'll discuss the opportunities in deploying multi-chain dApps on Hedera using Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) tools, along with real-life examples of successful projects. We'll also explore how developers can benefit from both ecosystems while reaching new users and communities.
